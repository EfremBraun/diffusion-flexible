Whitelam 2016: study in which they measured the diffusion coefficients of molecules inside of MOF-74 using the potential energies measured by
Thonhauser 2013: study in which they measured potential energies of adsorbates inside of MOF-74 using DFT. Your main job is to replicate Figure 2b of this paper but using a force field, and then to make them free energies instead of potential energies.
Smit 2016: study in which they generated force fields for CO2 and H2O in MOF-74. You'd have to implement these force fields into RASPA.

RASPA is available for download from https://github.com/numat/RASPA2/. There's a great manual in Docs/raspa.pdf. The manual doesn't state it, but if you use the keyword 'ComputeFreeEnergyProfile' then it'll compute the free energies for you using Widom insertions. Not sure how well it works.
I've also included the manual of an earlier version of RASPA called COTA. Chapter 16 of the COTA manual is worth a read to learn about free energies profiles.

I'd first take a look at Berend's book, section 7.2.1, which covers Widom insertions. TO understand it, you may first need to read chapter 2. You won't understand everything, I promise you, so don't try. Just get to a point where you understand the idea of how Widom insertions can give you free energies.
